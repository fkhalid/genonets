# Genonets

Welcome to the latest version of Genonets. The project now uses Python 3.8+, 
with several feature and performance upgrades. A previous version based on 
Python 2 was used as the backend for the 
[Genonets Server](#Genonets-Server-end-of-life).

## Documentation

Installation and usage instructions, as well as further documentation is 
available [here](https://genonets.readthedocs.io/).

## Genonets Server end-of-life

The Genonets Server had to be shut down due to lack of funding for web hosting 
services. Nevertheless, all analyses are still available in the Genonets 
package via this repository.
