Result attributes
=================

The following types of result files are generated once all the requested
analyses have completed.

1. **Genotype_set_measures.tsv:**  All phenotype/genotype-set level results
   are reported in this file.
2. **<genotype-set-name>_genotype_measures:** All genotype-level results are
   reported in this file. The <genotype-set-name> is just a place holder for
   the name of the genotype-set whose genotypes are being reported. One file is
   generated per genotype-set.
3. **Genotype_set_overlap.tsv:** This file is organized as a symmetric matrix,
   where the first row and first column constitute names of all genotype sets
   being analyzed, all diagonal values are *NaN*, and each of the rest of the
   cells contains the No. of overlapping genotypes between the two genotype-
   sets represented by the corresponding row and column headers. The following
   figure provides an example:

.. image:: images/overlap_result_example.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50 %

4. **phenotype_network.gml:** The analysis_phenotype_network stored in GML
   format.
5. **<genotype-set-name>.gml:** The entire genotype network corresponding to
   *genotype-set-name* stored in GML format.
6. **<genotype-set-name>_dominant.gml:** The dominant genotype network
   corresponding to the *genotype-set-name* stored in GML format.
7. **Epistasis squares:** If the input parameter :ref:`store-epistasis-squares
   <args_store_epistasis_squares>` is enabled and epistasis analysis is used,
   all squares are written to disk. Four files are generated, where each file
   corresponds to one of the epistasis types, including 'no epistasis'. Once
   the analysis is complete, these files are compressed into a zip archive
   called :code:`epistasis_squares.zip`. The archive is available in the output
   directory.

The following sections describe the various output attributes.

Genotype-set-level results
